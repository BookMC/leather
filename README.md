MIT mappings for Minecraft with no exceptions

## Tasks
### `generateJar`
The `generateJar` task will get the current branch name and try to resolve
a minecraft version from it. Once it has it will download it's client jar
and server jar with the obfuscated game. From there on you can now load it
into Enigma yourself and start mapping!
